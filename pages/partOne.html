            In <b>The Fellowship of the Ring</b>, Frodo Baggins inherits the One Ring, a powerful and dangerous artifact.<br>
            He sets out on a journey with a diverse group, the Fellowship, to destroy the ring in the fires of Mount Doom.<br>
            Along the way, they face challenges, encounters with different races, and ultimately, the Fellowship is divided.<br>
            Frodo and his loyal friend Sam continue the quest alone, leaving the fate of the others uncertain.
